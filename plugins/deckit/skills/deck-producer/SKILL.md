description: Main Deckit coordinator for end-to-end image-first deck production. Use whenever Deckit is explicitly invoked, including topic-only prompts like "@deckit 介绍一下 F-16", even if the user did not say slides/PPT. Runs brief, storyboard, visual prompts, official $imagegen slide generation, review, and PPTX image-container packaging unless the user explicitly asks for text-only/no deck artifacts or a required tool is unavailable.

# Deck Producer

Act as the production owner for Deckit deck work. Optimize for a usable image-first presentation under real constraints: source quality, token budget, time, image generation cost, and requested output.

Deckit v0.3 has one active production route: **image-first with actual image generation, followed by review and PPTX image-container packaging**. Do not choose, suggest, or implement alternate native-PowerPoint or mixed production routes during normal runs.

## Invocation Default

When the user explicitly invokes Deckit (`@deckit`, "use Deckit", "用 Deckit", or selecting the Deckit plugin), assume they want Deckit to produce a complete presentation deliverable, not a plain prose answer.

Do not respond with "you have not asked for slides yet" when Deckit was explicitly invoked. If the user did not explicitly say "use defaults", "no questions", or "just proceed", start with the recommendation gate below; once the user accepts, requests more options, or supplies custom constraints, turn the request into a deck seed and start the image-first workflow.

Treat these as deck-production intents when Deckit is invoked:

- "介绍一下..."
- "讲讲..."
- "分析..."
- "总结..."
- "整理..."
- "做一下..."
- "explain..."
- "introduce..."
- "summarize..."
- "analyze..."
- "brief me on..."

Examples:

- `@deckit 介绍一下 F-16 战斗机` → show a recommended Deckit plan first; after the user accepts or adjusts it, produce an F-16 image-first deck end to end: brief, storyboard, prompts, generated slide PNGs, review, and the chosen delivery package.
- `@deckit summarize this article` → produce an article-summary deck end to end unless the user explicitly asks only for a summary.
- `@deckit 讲讲普卡拉战斗机` → produce a topic-source deck run end to end.

Minimum default output for an explicit Deckit invocation is a complete Deckit deliverable:

1. `work/deck-brief.md`
2. `work/storyboard.md`
3. `prompts/README.md` and `prompts/<slide-id>.md`
4. `assets/generated-slides/<slide-id>.png` from the official `$imagegen` skill
5. the chosen packaged final delivery target when packaging is available; default is `dist/<deck-name>.pptx` as a non-editable image container
6. `dist/review.md` and, for PPTX, an audit result

After the recommendation gate has been accepted or bypassed by explicit user instruction, do not stop at prose, a brief, a storyboard, or a prompt pack merely to ask whether to continue. Continue through `$imagegen` and packaging by default. Stop early only when the user explicitly requests a partial artifact, explicitly forbids slides/images/PPTX, or a required tool is unavailable.

Exceptions: answer directly instead of starting a deck run when the user asks what Deckit can do, asks to install/debug/inspect/review Deckit, explicitly requests text-only output, or explicitly says not to create slides/deck artifacts.

## Recommendation Gate

Before creating run artifacts or invoking `$imagegen`, Deckit should normally pause once and show a recommended production plan. This protects users from hidden defaults while avoiding an up-front form. The recommendation gate is mandatory for explicit Deckit production requests unless the user already gave a complete production specification or explicitly said to use defaults / no questions / just proceed.

The recommendation gate must be lightweight:

- Do enough thinking to propose a good plan, but do not create run artifacts, write files, call `$imagegen`, or package outputs before the user responds.
- Show the recommended quality, slide count, final delivery target, and rough 3-6 section outline. Include aspect ratio only when it is likely to matter.
- Then stop and ask for exactly one of these choices:
  - `A` = accept the recommendation and start production.
  - `B` = show more options across the key dimensions.
  - `C` = let the user add custom requirements.
- If the user replies `A`, `默认`, `default`, or an equivalent acceptance, proceed using the recommended plan and record it in `work/deck-brief.md` "Skill Notes".
- If the user replies `B`, run the expanded preflight options flow below.
- If the user replies `C`, ask for or accept the user's custom requirements, then proceed after the custom constraints are clear enough. If the custom input is still ambiguous, ask only for the missing fields.

Use this default style:

```text
我建议这样做：
- 质量：balanced
- 页数：8 页
- 输出：PPTX（图片式非编辑容器），并自动生成 preview
- 粗大纲：A → B → C → D

请选择：
A 接受推荐方案，直接制作
B 展开更多选项让我挑
C 我补充自定义需求
```

If the user prompt already includes enough constraints to choose defaults safely, still show a concise recommendation and pause once unless the user explicitly said to skip questions. Do not ask the user to restate information already provided; map their words into the plan. Example: "高质量" maps to `premium`, "6 页" maps to 6 slides, "输出 PDF" maps to `pdf`.

## Expanded Preflight Options

Use the expanded preflight options flow when the user chooses `B` from the recommendation gate, or when their custom `C` response asks to choose from options. This flow is a selectable options panel, not the default first response.

The expanded preflight should ask at most four concise items, in this order:

1. **Quality / budget level**: `quick`, `balanced`, or `premium`. Default is `balanced`.
2. **Approximate page/slide count**: offer a few concrete choices instead of asking a yes/no question. Put the recommended choice first, based on budget and topic complexity; also allow a free-form custom count/range. For example:
   - `标准 8 页（推荐）` — balanced default for most topics.
   - `精简 5 页` — faster and cheaper.
   - `完整 12 页` — more comprehensive, higher cost.
   - `自定义 N 页` — user-specified.
   For `quick`, prefer choices around 5 / 6 / 7. For `balanced`, prefer 6 / 8 / 10. For `premium`, prefer 8 / 12 / 14.
3. **Rough outline proposal**: provide a coarse 3-6 section outline inferred from the prompt and ask whether to accept or revise it. Keep this as a lightweight framing check, not a full storyboard.
4. **Final delivery target**:
   - `pptx` — default; non-editable image-container PPTX after generated slide PNGs exist.
   - `pdf` — image-only PDF, one generated slide image per page.

When image aspect ratio is likely to matter, include it in the same compact preflight block rather than adding a separate question. Default to landscape `169` for ordinary computer/projector decks, but offer common alternatives and a custom-ratio code. Custom ratios must stay within `$imagegen` / `gpt-image-2` constraints: the long-to-short ratio must be `<= 3:1`, and the eventual pixel size must use edges that are multiples of `16px`, max edge `<= 3840px`, with total pixels between `655,360` and `8,294,400`. If the user's requested custom ratio is outside `1:3` through `3:1`, ask them to choose another ratio before image generation.

Generated slide PNGs are always kept under `assets/generated-slides/` as intermediate artifacts, so they are not a final delivery choice. A medium-size vertical preview image is also a standard artifact and should be produced automatically; do not ask the user to choose it as a delivery target.

Use a compact override-code format. Put the default plan first, then tell the user they can reply with `默认` / `default` to start, or reply only with the short codes they want to override. The user must not have to repeat item numbers such as `1 quick 2 8页`.

Short-code rules:

- Use one globally unique code per option within the preflight block; do not rely on question numbers for disambiguation.
- Prefer letters and digits only. Avoid punctuation and symbols in user-entered codes.
- Codes are case-insensitive. Display codes in uppercase, but parse `q`, `Q`, `pdf`, and `PDF` equivalently by trimming whitespace and uppercasing before matching.
- Use semantic codes where possible: `Q` = quick, `B` = balanced, `P` = premium, `PPTX` = pptx, `PDF` = pdf, `O` = revise outline.
- Use plain numbers for page counts when unambiguous: `5`, `8`, `12`.
- Use plain digits for aspect ratios if aspect ratio is offered: `169` = 16:9, `916` = 9:16, `43` = 4:3, `11` = 1:1.
- For a free custom ratio, use `R<width>BY<height>` with letters and digits only, such as `R21BY9` or `R4BY5`. Parse it case-insensitively and validate that the ratio is within `1:3` through `3:1` before proceeding.
- If codes conflict, lengthen the code instead of using punctuation or case distinctions. For example, keep `P` for premium and use `PPTX` for PowerPoint.
- If a preflight ever needs many options, continue with Excel-style alphanumeric codes such as `A`...`Z`, `AA`, `AB`, while still keeping each code unique in that block.

Use a short answer format such as the following:

```text
为了避免跑偏，我先确认几个默认值。
默认：B / 8页 / PPTX / 接受粗大纲
粗大纲：A → B → C → D

回复“默认”直接开始；或只回复要改的短码，可多个组合：
Q = quick
P = premium
5 = 5页
12 = 12页
PDF = 输出 PDF
O = 修改粗大纲

例：q 12 pdf
=> quick，12页，输出 PDF，其余默认
```

If aspect ratio is relevant, include it in the default line and code list using the same punctuation-free convention:

```text
默认：B / 8页 / 169 / PPTX / 接受粗大纲
916 = 竖屏 9:16
43 = 4:3
11 = 1:1
R21BY9 = 自定义 21:9；可改成 R宽BY高，比例必须在 1:3 到 3:1 内
```

If the user answers partially, infer the rest from defaults and continue. Treat short-code answers as overrides on top of the default plan; for example `q 916 pdf` means quick, vertical 9:16, PDF, and all other defaults. If the user accepts the outline, treat that outline as a constraint for `story-architect` and `slide-storyboarder`.

If the user prompt is complete and the recommendation gate was bypassed by explicit user instruction, convert the provided constraints directly into production settings. For example:

- explicit quality language such as "快速草稿", "标准质量", or "高质量" maps to `quick`, `balanced`, or `premium`;
- explicit page count such as "做 6 页" or "10-12 页" maps to `requested_output.target_slide_count`;
- explicit structure such as "按 背景/问题/方案/案例/结论 展开" becomes the accepted rough outline;
- explicit delivery format such as "给我 PDF" or "做成 PPTX" maps to the final delivery target.
- if the user asks for PNGs or a preview/long image, keep the generated slide PNGs and standard vertical preview as artifacts, but do not treat PNGs or stitched images as final delivery targets unless the user explicitly asks for a partial image-only run.

The recommendation gate and expanded preflight are **not** continuation gates. They are allowed only before expensive production starts. Once the user has accepted the recommendation, chosen options, supplied custom requirements, or explicitly skipped questions, do not insert additional approval checkpoints between brief, storyboard, prompts, image generation, and packaging.

Record recommendation/preflight decisions when possible:

- `run.json`: `budget_mode`, `requested_output.delivery_target`, and `requested_output.target_slide_count`.
- `work/deck-brief.md`: "Skill Notes" with quality level, target page count, accepted outline, final delivery target, assumptions, standard preview expectation, and unanswered items filled by defaults.
- `work/storyboard.md`: Deck Meta or notes explaining any deviation from the requested page count or outline.

## No Continuation Gate

Deckit should not insert a user-confirmation checkpoint between normal production stages.

Forbidden during an explicit Deckit run:

- Ending the turn after a plain topic explanation with "I can turn this into slides next."
- Ending the turn after `work/storyboard.md` / `prompts/*.md` with "Say continue to generate images."
- Asking the user to confirm image generation when `$imagegen` is available and the run is not explicitly text-only.
- Asking whether to package as PPTX after all slide PNGs exist and packaging tools are available.

The only exception is the **Recommendation Gate**, which normally asks once before artifact production begins unless the user explicitly skipped questions or already gave a complete production specification.

Instead, announce the route briefly in commentary, then continue. Budget mode may change slide count and critique depth, but it must not silently downgrade an explicit Deckit invocation into "outline only" or "prompt pack only".

## Native PPTX Firewall

PPTX is allowed only as a delivery container, never as a production method.

Never satisfy ambiguous requests such as "make a PPT", "create a PowerPoint", "make slides", "produce a presentation", "制作 PPT", "做 PPT", "帮我做个演示文稿", or "生成 PowerPoint" by creating editable native PowerPoint shapes, text boxes, charts, or layouts. Interpret ambiguous presentation requests as Deckit's image-first route:

> Create an image-first presentation: brief, storyboard, image prompts, and generated full-slide images.

Do not ask the user to choose between image-first and native-PPTX. Native-PPTX is not an active option. If the user asks for a `.pptx` file, treat it only as an optional package after `$imagegen` has produced slide PNGs; the package must contain one generated full-slide image per page and must not contain native editable slide construction.

If the user explicitly requires editable PowerPoint objects, state the limitation and do not switch routes:

> Deckit does not produce editable native-PPTX decks in the active route. I can continue with image-first full-slide images, optionally packaged into a non-editable `.pptx` container.

## No Substitute Visual PPTX

Visual polish does not make a deck image-first. A visually designed PowerPoint file is still native-PPTX if its slides contain editable text boxes, PowerPoint shapes, lines, charts, tables, or layout objects.

If `$imagegen` is unavailable or fails and `assets/generated-slides/<slide-id>.png` does not exist for every storyboard slide, do not deliver PPTX/PDF packages or preview images. Stop at the prompt pack and say generated slide images are pending. Do not choose this branch merely because the user has not written a separate "continue" message.

Do not create native PowerPoint layouts as a substitute for generated images. Do not create a native-PPTX first and then backfill Deckit artifacts (`run.json`, `work/`, `prompts/`, or `dist/review.md`) to make it look like a Deckit run. Deckit artifacts must precede delivery and control the production path.

When a PPTX exists, audit it:

```powershell
deckit-dev audit-pptx --pptx <file.pptx>
```

The audit must pass with exactly one full-slide picture per slide. If it reports `PPTX-NATIVE-CONTENT`, the file is not a valid Deckit image-first deliverable.

## PPTX Packaging Discipline

A `.pptx` deliverable is allowed only after generated slide PNGs exist. Use the stable packaging route instead of inventing a PPTX writer during the run:

```powershell
deckit-dev package-images --run <run-folder>
```

Packaging requirements:

- Source images must be `assets/generated-slides/<slide-id>.png`, one for every storyboard slide.
- The package must contain one slide per storyboard slide, in storyboard order.
- Each PPTX slide must contain exactly one generated full-slide image sized to the slide canvas.
- Each PPTX slide must include speaker notes in PowerPoint's notes pane, sourced from `Speaker notes` / `Presenter notes` / `Presenter intent` in `work/storyboard.md` or synthesized from the slide's claim and support points.
- Do not hand-write minimal OpenXML `.pptx` zip packages for delivery; PowerPoint may reject or repair them.
- Do not add editable text boxes, native charts, native tables, or PowerPoint shape layouts.
- After packaging, run `deckit-dev review --run <run-folder>` and keep `dist/review.md`.

## Debug Evidence Mode

When the user asks to debug a Deckit run, investigate a failed output, or compare expected vs actual routing, preserve evidence instead of only summarizing. Record:

- the exact user prompt or routing trigger;
- the resolved production route and budget;
- the exact commands run (`new-run`, `package-images`, `package-pdf`, `package-preview`, `audit-pptx`, `review`);
- paths to `run.json`, source, brief, storyboard, prompts, generated PNGs, PPTX, review, and audit output;
- whether `$imagegen` was invoked, skipped, unavailable, or simulated;
- any failed quality gates and the concrete file/line or slide that caused them.

Prefer writing this into `dist/debug-evidence.md` when a run folder exists. Do not overwrite failing artifacts until the evidence has been captured.

## Final Delivery Targets and Standard Preview

Final delivery targets remain image-first. They package generated full-slide PNGs; they do not permit native editable PowerPoint construction. The final delivery choice should be only `pptx` or `pdf`.

- `pptx` (default): after all expected `assets/generated-slides/<slide-id>.png` files exist, run:

  ```powershell
  deckit-dev package-images --run <run-folder>
  ```

- `pdf`: after generated slide PNGs exist, run:

  ```powershell
  deckit-dev package-pdf --run <run-folder>
  ```

  This packages the slide PNGs as lossless full-page PDF image objects. It should preserve slide-image fidelity by default, even when the resulting PDF is large.

Generated slide PNGs are always retained under `assets/generated-slides/` as intermediate artifacts, in storyboard order. They are useful for inspection and reuse, but they are not a final delivery target in the preflight choice.

A medium-size vertical preview image is a standard artifact and should be produced automatically after generated slide PNGs exist. It is not a user-selected final delivery target. Generate it with:

```powershell
deckit-dev package-preview --run <run-folder>
```

Preview requirements:

- Output path: `dist/preview.png` by default.
- Use the generated slide PNGs in storyboard order.
- Stack slides vertically in a single column, top to bottom, because this is easier to scan on mobile.
- Keep the preview medium-size rather than full-resolution long-image delivery; it only needs to show the overall visual flow clearly.

If the user requests multiple final delivery targets, produce the primary requested target first, then secondary PPTX/PDF packages only after the same generated PNGs exist. The preview should still exist either way.

## Workflow

1. Identify the user's source material and desired output. Run the **Recommendation Gate** once unless the user explicitly skipped questions or already gave a complete production specification. If Deckit was explicitly invoked and the source is only a topic or instruction, treat it as a source seed for a complete deck after recommendation/defaults. If the source is a `.pdf` or an `http(s)` URL, route through `document-ingestor` first to produce `source/input.md`.
2. Record `production_mode: image-first`. Do not ask the user to choose among production modes.
3. Choose a **budget mode**: `quick`, `balanced`, or `premium`. The default when the user is silent is `balanced`.
4. Record the requested final delivery target and target slide/page count when known.
5. Select the minimum specialist workflow needed.
6. Keep intermediate artifacts in predictable paths.
7. Invoke the official `$imagegen` skill to generate full-slide images from the prompt pack unless the user explicitly asked for a partial/text-only artifact or `$imagegen` is unavailable.
8. Package generated slide images according to the final delivery target when packaging is available, and ensure `dist/preview.png` is produced as the standard preview artifact.
9. Apply quality gates before calling the work done.

Use `../../references/workflow.md` for the production flow and `../../references/budget-modes.md` for budget decisions.

## Image-First Route

The only active production mode is `image-first`.

`visual-director` writes complete per-slide image-generation prompts. The final deck is a sequence of generated full-slide images saved in the run folder. Use this path even if the user eventually wants the images packaged into a `.pptx`.

Hard rules:

- A `.pptx` containing one full-slide PNG per slide is only a **packaging format** after the images already exist. It does not prove image-first generation by itself.
- Programmatically drawing slide PNGs with local code (PIL, matplotlib, browser screenshots, SVG, HTML/CSS, or PowerPoint shapes) is local rendering, not image-first generation.
- Do not invoke third-party presentation/PPTX skills or plugins during Deckit runs, including Codex `Presentations` and Anthropic `pptx`. They tend to produce native PowerPoint elements and will pull the workflow back into a route v0.3 intentionally disables.
- If the user explicitly invokes Deckit, or asks to "generate images", "use gpt-image", "use gpt-image-2", or "image-first", invoke `$imagegen` for each slide image, then store the resulting PNGs under a path such as `assets/generated-slides/`.
- `$imagegen` is the required handoff for actual slide image generation when that skill is available. Do not replace it with Python, PIL, browser screenshots, SVG, PowerPoint, or other local rendering code.
- If image generation is not available, stop after prompt production and say that generated slide images are pending; do not fake the generation step with local drawing code.
- If the user explicitly asks for editable PowerPoint, explain that the active Deckit route is image-first and produces non-editable slide images; do not switch to an editable shape-by-shape deck workflow.

Record the route in:

- `run.json` (when the dev tool created the run folder).
- The deck brief's "Skill Notes" section.
- The first line of `prompts/README.md`.

## Source Inputs (V1)

V1 accepts three source kinds, all normalized into `source/input.md` inside the run folder:

- Text or Markdown files (`.md`, `.markdown`, `.txt`) — copied directly.
- `.pdf` files — routed through `document-ingestor` for text extraction.
- `http(s)` URLs — routed through `document-ingestor` for HTML-to-Markdown.

Standard local run shape:

- `source/input.md` (or `source/input.txt` for raw text)
- `work/deck-brief.md`
- `work/storyboard.md`
- `prompts/README.md` and `prompts/<slide-id>.md`
- `assets/generated-slides/<slide-id>.png` when images are generated
- `dist/` and `dist/review.md`

Output-root policy:

- Put the run folder under the user's active working directory, preferably `<workdir>/outputs/<run-name>/`.
- Do not create or leave Deckit production artifacts inside the plugin installation directory, plugin cache, or the Deckit development repository.
- `local-runs/` is only for Deckit repository development and smoke tests. It is not a normal-user output location.
- If a dev checkout/tool is used while answering a user request, pass `--runs-dir` explicitly to point at the user's working directory; do not rely on the tool's repo-local defaults.

When the repository development tool is available, create the run folder with:

```powershell
cd <workdir>
uv --project <deckit-dev-repo>\tools run deckit-dev new-run --runs-dir .\outputs --source .\path\to\source.md --name run-name --mode image-first --budget balanced --delivery-target pptx --target-slides 8
uv --project <deckit-dev-repo>\tools run deckit-dev new-run --runs-dir .\outputs --source .\path\to\source.pdf --name run-name --mode image-first --budget balanced --delivery-target pdf --target-slides 8
uv --project <deckit-dev-repo>\tools run deckit-dev new-run --runs-dir .\outputs --source https://example.com/post --name run-name --mode image-first --budget balanced --delivery-target pptx --target-slides 8
```

Use the run folder as the working root for specialist outputs.

## Specialist Routing

- Use `document-ingestor` when the user provides a PDF or URL instead of text.
- Use `story-architect` when raw source material needs a deck-level thesis and narrative structure.
- Use `slide-storyboarder` when a brief or outline needs page-by-page slide planning.
- Use `visual-director` when a storyboard needs visual treatment or image prompts.

Do not run every specialist by default. Skip steps that the user's input already satisfies.

## Default Artifacts

Image-first mode:

- `work/deck-brief.md`
- `work/storyboard.md`
- `prompts/README.md`
- `prompts/<slide-id>.md`
- `assets/generated-slides/<slide-id>.png` after an actual image-generation step has run
- `dist/<deck-name>.pptx` or `.pdf` as a package around generated images, not as the primary image-generation method
- `dist/preview.png` as the standard medium-size vertical preview image

Do not create native PowerPoint layout specs as a substitute for image prompts. Do not create native PowerPoint shapes as the final deck production path.

## Quality Gates

Before delivery, verify that:

- The deck has one clear central thesis.
- Each slide has one primary job.
- Slide titles are specific and presentable.
- The sequence has a logical arc.
- Visual direction supports the argument.
- In image-first mode, generated PNGs came from `$imagegen` if the run claims to have generated images and `$imagegen` was available.
- The chosen workflow fits the user's budget and timing.
- `production_mode` is recorded as `image-first` in `run.json` and the brief's "Skill Notes".

Run the gate by either reading every artifact and checking each item by hand, or (preferred when available) by running `deckit-dev review --run <name>` and archiving the output to `dist/review.md`. Do not declare delivery without one of the two.
