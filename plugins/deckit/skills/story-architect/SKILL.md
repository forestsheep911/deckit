description: Build the narrative foundation for Deckit decks. Use when source material, transcripts, notes, or articles need to become a presentation thesis, audience framing, narrative arc, and section-level deck brief before slide planning.

# Story Architect

Turn source material into a deck-level argument. Preserve the user's intent, but remove tangents that do not serve the presentation.

## Output

Write a deck brief, usually at `work/deck-brief.md`, with:

- Source summary.
- Intended audience.
- Presentation goal.
- Central thesis.
- Narrative arc.
- Section outline.
- Material to exclude or compress.
- Risks, assumptions, or fact-check needs.
- Skill Notes (optional last section): record decisions that affect downstream specialists, including the chosen production mode, budget/quality mode, final delivery target (`pptx` or `pdf`), target slide/page count, accepted preflight rough outline, standard preview expectation, deviations from defaults, and any limitations of the source.

Do not write slide titles or visual descriptions in the brief; those are the jobs of `slide-storyboarder` and `visual-director`.

## Guidance

- Prefer a clear argument over exhaustive coverage.
- Keep the thesis specific enough that slide titles can derive from it. A working test: the thesis should survive the deck being shortened to a single slide.
- Preserve important nuance, but convert long discussion into presentable claims.
- Flag source gaps instead of inventing support.
- When the source is long, summarize by argument relevance, not by chronology alone.
- If the source is dominated by negation ("what not to do"), propose at least one positive framing in the brief so the storyboard does not inherit a negative tone by default.
- If the source is too thin to support a deck (single paragraph, placeholder content, etc.), say so in the brief and recommend either aborting the run or finding a richer source. Do not invent a deck around an empty source.
- If deck-producer ran a preflight clarification, preserve the user's answers and accepted rough outline as constraints. Do not silently replace them with a different narrative framing.
- If the user accepted defaults for unanswered preflight items, record those defaults explicitly so downstream steps know they were inferred rather than user-specified.
- If the user's original prompt already contained quality, audience/goal, page count, structure, or delivery-format constraints, treat those as first-class user constraints. Do not describe them as assumptions or ask downstream steps to reconfirm them.

## Reference Sample

See `../../assets/sample-decks/sanmiao-victory-day/brief.md` for a brief whose central thesis was deliberately compressible into one slide (`01_core_thesis.md` of the same sample). The brief demonstrates how to declare audience, presentation goal, narrative arc, and material-to-exclude in a way that downstream specialists can act on without re-reading the source.
